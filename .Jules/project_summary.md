# Project Status & Changes Summary

**Project**: Toddler Learning Game
**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: 2025-12-26

## 1. Overview
This document summarizes the recent extensive updates to the Toddler Learning Game, focusing on UI/UX polishing, responsive design (landscape optimization), audio enhancements, and bug fixes. The goal was to create a premium, "app-like" experience running in the browser.

## 2. Key Features & Changes

### A. Visual & UI Overhaul
*   **Game Icons**: Replaced generic emojis with custom-generated 3D-style PNG icons (rendered on white backgrounds) for a cleaner, professional look in the menu.
*   **Typography**: Integrated **"Comic Neue"** from Google Fonts globally to ensure a friendly, playful, and readable aesthetic for toddlers.
*   **Home Screen**:
    *   **Play Button**: significantly enlarged and centered for easy interactions.
    *   **Parents Button**: Anchored to the bottom center, distinct from gameplay elements.
    *   **Decluttered**: Utility buttons (Mute, Update) moved to corners.
*   **Game Header**: Redesigned as a "floating pill" style to maximize screen real estate while keeping Score and Navigation accessible.
*   **Celebrations**: Enhanced "Good Job" overlays with bouncy animations, rainbow gradients, and confetti logic.

### B. Responsive Design (Landscape Optimization)
*   **Horizontal Layout**: Optimized CSS (`@media (orientation: landscape)`) to ensure the game fits perfectly on landscape screens (1024x768+) without scrolling.
*   **Flexbox Grid**:
    *   **Standard Games**: Source and Target columns now flow items horizontally.
    *   **Feed Lion**: Lion and food tray arranged side-by-side.
    *   **Game Menu**: Expands to utilize the full screen width.
*   **No Scrolling**: Adjusted VH (Viewport Height) units to keep all interactive elements "above the fold."

### C. Audio Enhancements
*   **Math Game Voice**: Implemented TTS (Text-to-Speech) feedback for equations.
    *   *Behavior*: When a player drops a number, the game speaks: *"Two... Plus... Three... Equals... Five!"*
    *   *Tech*: Updated `generate_sprites.py` to include "plus", "minus", "equals" and regenerated sprites.
*   **Feed Lion Sound**: Replaced generic TTS with a procedural "Crunch" sound effect using Web Audio API (white noise synthesis) for a realistic eating experience.
*   **Mute Logic**: Separated **Background Music** from **Sound Effects**.
    *   The "Mute" button now toggles *only* the background music loop.
    *   Educational voiceovers and SFX (crunch, victory) play regardless of the music setting.

### D. Parental Gate
*   **UI Polish**: Styled the keypad with rounded corners, soft shadows, and a friendly blue color scheme to match the game.
*   **UX Improvement**: Added a "Close" (❌) button to the overlay so parents can exit easily if accidentally triggered.
*   **Interaction**: Added active states to buttons for better tactile feedback.

### E. Bug Fixes
*   **Difficulty Buttons**: Fixed an issue where clicking the text inside "Easy/Med/Hard" buttons wouldn't trigger the change. Updated event listeners to use `e.currentTarget`.
*   **Navigation**: Made tasks in the "Daily Challenge" menu clickable, taking the user directly to the specific game mode.
*   **Audio Keys**: Fixed missing audio keys (e.g., `correct` -> `generic_correct`) to prevent console warnings and silence.

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure Highlights
*   `css/style.css`: Contains the bulk of the visual updates, including the new landscape media queries (`@media (orientation: landscape)`) and animation keyframes.
*   `js/engine/audio.js`: Centralized audio manager. Handles sprite playback (`speakSequence`), procedural sounds (`playCrunchSound`), and the new mute logic.
*   `js/games/*.js`: Individual game logic files. Specifically, `math.js` and `standard.js` were updated to support the new audio key structures.
*   `tools/generate_sprites.py`: Python script used to generate the `sprites.mp3` and `sprites.json` from text definitions.

### Known State
*   **Audio**: `assets/audio/sprites.mp3` and `sprites.json` are current and include math terms.
*   **Icons**: Most icons are converted to PNG. Some (Math, Letters, Story) were queued for generation but might still be using placeholders or older versions if the quota prevented full regeneration.

## 4. Next Steps / Recommendations
*   **Verify Icon Consistency**: Ensure all game icons usage consistent white backgrounds (check `assets/images/game_icons/`).
*   **Performance**: Monitor the Web Audio API usage on lower-end mobile devices, though the current implementation is lightweight.
*   **Content**: capable of easily adding more words/items to `js/data/content.js`.
